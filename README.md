<h1>Data Structures & Algorithms</h1>
<p>A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.</p>
<p>Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages. </p>
<p>Data structure has many different uses in our daily life. There are many different data structures that are used to solve different mathematical and logical problems. By using data structure, one can organize and process a very large amount of data in a relatively short period. </p>
<h2>Types of Data Structures</h2>

<p>Data structures can be broadly categorized into two types: Linear and Non-linear data structures.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Linear Data Structures</li>
	<li>Non-Linear Data Structures</li>
</ol>
<h3>Linear Data Structures</h3>
<p>Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.</p>
<p>There are two types of linear data structures</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Static data structure</strong> : Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. </li>
	<p>Eg : Array</p>
	<li><strong>Dynamic data structure</strong> : In the dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. </li>
	<p>Eg : Queue,Stack,Linked List</p>
</ol>

<h3>Non-linear Data Structure</h3>
<p>Non-linear data structures are data structures in which data elements are not arranged in a sequential order.</p>
<p>These structures allow more complex relationships among elements</p>
<p>Non-linear data structures are essential for representing and managing hierarchical and interconnected data.</p>
<p>Eg : Tree, Graph</p>
