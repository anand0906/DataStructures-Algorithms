<h1>Self Introduction</h1>
<p>Sure! My name is Anand, and I'm a full-stack developer with two years of professional experience at Infosys. Prior to this , I completed a couple of internships during my graduation, where I worked as a web developer using the Django framework.After joining in Infosys, I received training in full-stack development, focusing on Java and Angular.</p>
<p>After completing my training, I was allocated to a project related to North American transportation, where I primarily worked on REST API development using Spring Boot and UI Development with Angular.</p>
<p>Although I love my current role, I feel Iâ€™m now ready for a more challenging assignment and this position really excites me to explore my skills.</p>
