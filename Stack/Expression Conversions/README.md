<h1>Expression Conversions</h1>
<h2>Expression</h2>
<p>An expression is a combination of operands(values,variables or literals) and operators (symbols) that is evaluated to produce value.</p>
<p><strong>Examples :</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Airthmetic Expression :</strong>3 + 5 * 2</li>
	<p><strong>Result :</strong>13</p>
	<li><strong>Logical Expression :</strong></li>
	<p>Evaluates to True or False</p>
	<li><strong>String Expression :</strong>'Hello' + ' World'</li>
	<p>Result: 'Hello World'</p>
</ul>
<h2>Expression Evaluation</h2>
<p>When you write an arithmetic expression like <strong>B * C</strong>, it follows a format called <strong>infix notation</strong>. In this format:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The operator (in this case, <strong>*</strong>, which stands for multiplication) is placed <strong>between</strong> the two values or variables it operates on (in this case, <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>).</li>
    <li>You can easily tell what is happening in the expression because the operator tells you that <strong>B</strong> is being multiplied by <strong>C</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ambiguity in Complex Expressions</strong></p>
<p>Now, consider a slightly more complicated example: <strong>A + B * C</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In this expression, there are <strong>two operators</strong>: <strong>+</strong> (addition) and <strong>*</strong> (multiplication).</li>
    <li>The question is: <strong>Which part of the expression do these operators apply to first?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Does <strong>+</strong> (addition) work on <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> first, so you calculate <strong>A + B</strong> and then multiply the result by <strong>C</strong>?</li>
        <li>Or does <strong>*</strong> (multiplication) work on <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> first, and then you add <strong>A</strong> to that result?</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Operator Precedence</strong></p>
<p>The reason this kind of expression doesn’t confuse you in practice is that you’ve learned a set of rules called <strong>operator precedence</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Precedence</strong> tells us which operator to apply first when there’s more than one in an expression.</li>
    <li>In math, <strong>multiplication</strong> (<strong>*</strong>) and <strong>division</strong> (<strong>/</strong>) have a <strong>higher precedence</strong> than <strong>addition</strong> (<strong>+</strong>) and <strong>subtraction</strong> (<strong>-</strong>).</li>
    <li>For example, in <strong>A + B * C</strong>, the rule is:
        <ol>
            <li>Do the multiplication (<strong>B * C</strong>) <strong>first</strong>.</li>
            <li>Then, add the result to <strong>A</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Associativity</strong></p>
<p>What happens if two operators have the <strong>same precedence</strong>? For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Consider the expression <strong>A - B + C</strong>. Both <strong>+</strong> (addition) and <strong>-</strong> (subtraction) have the <strong>same precedence</strong>.</li>
    <li>In such cases, another rule called <strong>associativity</strong> comes into play:
        <ul>
            <li>For addition and subtraction, the rule is <strong>left-to-right associativity</strong>.</li>
            <li>This means you evaluate the expression from <strong>left to right</strong>:
                <ol>
                    <li>First calculate <strong>A - B</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Then, add <strong>C</strong> to that result.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parentheses Override Precedence</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>You can use <strong>parentheses</strong> to control the order of operations.</li>
    <li>For example:
        <ul>
            <li>In <strong>(A + B) * C</strong>, the parentheses tell you to calculate <strong>A + B</strong> first, then multiply the result by <strong>C</strong>.</li>
            <li>Without the parentheses, the multiplication (<strong>B * C</strong>) would have been done first.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Expression: <strong>2 + 3 * 4</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Check precedence:
        <ul>
            <li>Multiplication (<strong>*</strong>) comes before addition (<strong>+</strong>), so do the multiplication first: <strong>3 * 4 = 12</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Now add the result to <strong>2</strong>: <strong>2 + 12 = 14</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the expression were written as <strong>(2 + 3) * 4</strong>, the parentheses would force addition to happen first:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>2 + 3 = 5</strong>.</li>
    <li>Then, multiply by 4: <strong>5 * 4 = 20</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why Computers Need Clear Order of Operations</strong></p>
<p>Although this may seem obvious to humans, computers need exact instructions about what operations to perform and in what order. To eliminate any confusion about order, we can use what is called a <strong>fully parenthesized expression</strong>. This type of expression uses one pair of parentheses for each operator, ensuring that the order of operations is explicit and there is no need to remember precedence rules.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The expression <strong>A + B * C + D</strong> can be rewritten as <strong>((A + (B * C)) + D)</strong> to show that multiplication happens first, followed by the leftmost addition.</li>
    <li>Similarly, <strong>A + B + C + D</strong> can be written as <strong>(((A + B) + C) + D)</strong> since addition operations are evaluated from left to right.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prefix and Postfix Notation</strong></p>
<p>There are two additional expression formats, called <strong>prefix</strong> and <strong>postfix</strong>, which may not be as familiar. Consider the infix expression <strong>A + B</strong>. What happens if we move the operator:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Before</strong> the operands: <strong>+ A B</strong> (prefix).</li>
    <li><strong>After</strong> the operands: <strong>A B +</strong> (postfix).</li>
</ul>

<p>These formats work as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prefix</strong>: The operator comes <strong>before</strong> its operands.</li>
    <li><strong>Postfix</strong>: The operator comes <strong>after</strong> its operands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few examples to clarify:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Infix Expression</th>
        <th>Prefix Expression</th>
        <th>Postfix Expression</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A + B</td>
        <td>+ A B</td>
        <td>A B +</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A + B * C</td>
        <td>+ A * B C</td>
        <td>A B C * +</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Understanding Prefix and Postfix with Complex Expressions</strong></p>
<p>Now consider the infix expression <strong>(A + B) * C</strong>. In infix, parentheses are required to ensure that addition is performed before multiplication. However, in prefix and postfix:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prefix:</strong> Move the addition operator before the operands (<strong>+ A B</strong>) and then place the multiplication operator in front of the entire expression. The result is <strong>* + A B C</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Postfix:</strong> Perform addition first by writing <strong>A B +</strong>. Then, apply the multiplication operator, resulting in <strong>A B + C *</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why No Parentheses in Prefix and Postfix?</strong></p>
<p>Notice that parentheses are not needed in prefix and postfix notations. This is because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The position of the operator completely determines the order of operations.</li>
    <li>Unlike infix, there is no ambiguity about which operands an operator applies to.</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, infix notation is often considered the least desirable format when it comes to clarity for computers.</p>

        <th>Prefix Expression</th>
        <th>Postfix Expression</th>

        <td>A + B * C + D</td>
        <td>+ + A * B C D</td>
        <td>A B C * + D +</td>
    </tr>

<p>So far, we have used informal, ad hoc methods to convert infix expressions into their equivalent prefix and postfix notations. While these methods work for simple examples, they become cumbersome and error-prone as the complexity of the expressions increases.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithmic Conversion</strong></p>
<p>As you might expect, there are algorithmic ways to convert between these notations. These algorithms provide a systematic approach to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any infix expression, regardless of its complexity, can be correctly transformed into its prefix or postfix equivalent.</li>
    <li>The precedence and associativity of operators are preserved in the resulting notation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Algorithmic methods are particularly useful because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They eliminate ambiguity and human error during conversion.</li>
    <li>They work for expressions with nested parentheses and multiple operators.</li>
    <li>They are efficient and can be implemented programmatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>These methods often rely on data structures such as <strong>stacks</strong> to manage operators and operands during the conversion process. By following a well-defined set of rules, these algorithms produce the correct prefix or postfix expressions in a step-by-step manner.</p>

<h2>Infix To Postfix</h2>
<p>In this conversions, operands remains in same relative position and only operators will change its position based on presedence rules and associativity</p>
<p><strong>a+b</strong></p>

```python
a+b

ab+
```
<p>Here we have moved + operator to end of the expression</p>

<p><strong>a+b+c</strong></p>

```python
a+b-c

ab+-c

ab+c-
```

<p>Here, we have two operations (a+b) and (b-c), according to presedence both are same, but associativity is left to right</p>
<ul>
	<li>First, a+b should be calculated, so its converted to ab+</li>
	<li>Then, result of (ab+) will be substracted with c, so ab+-c is converted to ab+c-</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>a+b*c</strong></p>

```python
a+b*c

a+bc*

abc*+
```
<p>Here, , multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so b * c happens first.then, a is added with result bc*, final expression will vbe abc*+</p>

<h3>Algorithm Intution :</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We know that, operands will stay in relative position, don’t affect the order of operations.</li>
	<li>Here, operators will change its position based on presedence and associativity</li>
	<li>Operators with higher presedence should be evaluated first.</li>
	<li>Operators with equal presedence must be evaluted based on associativity.(left-to-right for +, -, *, /, or right-to-left for ^).</li>
	<li>sub-expression inside paranthesis should be evaluted(rules same as above) first irresepctive of presedence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Detailed Explanation of the Rules with Examples</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Operands Stay in Relative Position</strong></p>
        <p>Operands (e.g., <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>) do not affect the order of operations. They simply stay in the order they appear in the expression.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Infix: A + B * C</p>
                <p>Operands are <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>. In postfix, these operands will remain in the same relative order as they appear in the expression: A B C. Operators (<strong>+</strong>, <strong>*</strong>) determine where these operands will go.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Operators Will Change Position Based on Precedence and Associativity</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Infix: A + B * C</p>
                <p><strong>Precedence:</strong> * has higher precedence than +. In postfix, * must come before +, even though it appears after + in infix.</p>
                <p><strong>Postfix Conversion Process:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Append A (operand).</li>
                    <li>Append B (operand).</li>
                    <li>Push * (operator) onto the stack because it has higher precedence.</li>
                    <li>Append C (operand).</li>
                    <li>Pop * from the stack and append it.</li>
                    <li>Push + onto the stack and pop it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Resulting Postfix:</strong> A B C * +</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Operators with Higher Precedence Are Evaluated First</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Infix: A + B * C</p>
                <p>The multiplication operator <strong>*</strong> must be evaluated before the addition operator <strong>+</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Postfix Conversion:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First append operands A, B, and C.</li>
                    <li>Push + onto the stack, but * has higher precedence and must be placed first.</li>
                    <li>Pop * from the stack before popping +.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Postfix Result:</strong> A B C * +</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Operators with Equal Precedence Must Be Evaluated Based on Associativity</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Example with Left-to-Right Associativity:</strong> Infix: A - B + C</p>
                <p>Both - and + have the same precedence and are left-associative. Process A - B first, then add C.</p>
                <p><strong>Postfix Conversion:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Append A and B.</li>
                    <li>Push - to the stack.</li>
                    <li>Pop - and append it when + appears (because of left-to-right associativity).</li>
                    <li>Append C.</li>
                    <li>Push + and pop it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Postfix Result:</strong> A B - C +</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Example with Right-to-Left Associativity:</strong> Infix: A ^ B ^ C</p>
                <p>^ has the same precedence but is <strong>right-associative</strong>. Process B ^ C first, then A ^ the result.</p>
                <p><strong>Postfix Conversion:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Append A, B, and C.</li>
                    <li>Push ^ (right-associative allows stacking another ^).</li>
                    <li>Pop the second ^ (B ^ C) before the first ^ (A ^).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Postfix Result:</strong> A B C ^ ^</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Sub-Expressions Inside Parentheses Are Evaluated First</strong></p>
        <p>Parentheses indicate a sub-expression that must be resolved completely before considering operators outside the parentheses. Precedence and associativity rules apply within the parentheses.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Infix: (A + B) * C</p>
                <p>The sub-expression <strong>(A + B)</strong> is evaluated first, regardless of precedence. Process + inside parentheses, then apply * to the result.</p>
                <p><strong>Postfix Conversion:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Push ( to the stack.</li>
                    <li>Append A and B.</li>
                    <li>Push + (resolve everything inside ().</li>
                    <li>Append + when ) is encountered.</li>
                    <li>Append C.</li>
                    <li>Push * and pop it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Postfix Result:</strong> A B + C *</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Code Explanation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Operand Handling:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If a character is alphanumeric (<code>isalnum()</code>), it is added directly to the output string <code>ans</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parentheses Handling:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Opening parentheses (<code>(</code>) are pushed onto the stack.</li>
    <li>Closing parentheses (<code>)</code>) cause operators to be popped and appended to <code>ans</code> until an opening parenthesis is encountered.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Operator Precedence and Associativity:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Operators are popped from the stack based on their precedence and associativity:</li>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Right-associative operators (<code>^</code>):</strong> Pop only higher precedence operators.</li>
        <li><strong>Left-associative operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>):</strong> Pop operators with equal or higher precedence.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>

<p><strong>Final Cleanup:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>After processing the input string, any remaining operators in the stack are appended to <code>ans</code>.</li>

<h2>Postfix To Infix</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Input Expression:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The input is assumed to be in postfix notation, where operands come before operators.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Stack Usage:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A stack is used to build the infix expression:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Operands are pushed onto the stack as they appear.</li>
                <li>Operators pop two operands from the stack, combine them with the operator in between, and push the result back onto the stack.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Returning the Result:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>After processing the entire postfix expression, the stack will contain only one element: the final infix expression.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

```python
def solve(s):
    n=len(s)
    stack=[]

<h2>Prefix To Infix</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Reversing the Prefix Expression:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The code first reverses the input prefix expression.</li>
            <li>This is because we need to process the expression in reverse to handle the operands and operators in the correct order (similar to how we process postfix expressions with stacks).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Processing the Reversed Expression:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>After reversing the string, the code processes each character in the reversed expression:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operands</strong> (alphanumeric characters) are pushed onto the stack.</li>
                <li><strong>Operators</strong> pop two operands from the stack, combine them with the operator in between, and push the result back onto the stack.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Returning the Result:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>After processing the entire reversed expression, the stack will contain only one element: the final infix expression.</li>

```python
def solve(s):
    # Step 1: Reverse the prefix expression
    s = s[::-1]
    n = len(s)
    stack = []

    # Step 2: Process each character in the reversed expression
    for i in range(n):
        # If the character is an operand (alphanumeric), push it onto the stack
        if s[i].isalnum():
            stack.append(s[i])
        else:
            # If the character is an operator, pop two operands, combine them, and push the result
            op1 = stack.pop()
            op2 = stack.pop()
            exp = f"{op1}{s[i]}{op2}"  # Form infix expression with the operator in between
            stack.append(exp)

    # Step 3: The final element in the stack is the infix expression
    return stack[-1]

# Input and output
s = input("Enter the prefix expression: ")

```


<p><strong>Example Walkthrough:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>For the input <code>*+ABCD</code>, the prefix expression will be evaluated as follows:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Reverse the expression: <code>DCBA+*</code>.</li>
        <li>Process the characters:
            <ul>
                <li>'D' is pushed onto the stack.</li>
                <li>'C' is pushed onto the stack.</li>
                <li>'B' is pushed onto the stack.</li>
                <li>'A' is pushed onto the stack.</li>
                <li>'+' pops 'A' and 'B', combines them into <code>(A+B)</code>, and pushes it back onto the stack.</li>
                <li>'*' pops <code>(A+B)</code> and 'C', combines them into <code>((A+B)*C)</code>, and the result is the final infix expression.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<h2>Postfix To Prefix</h2>

<p>Since, postfix expression is following presedence and associviativity, just loop through give expression and replace operator position based on prefix rules</p>

<p><strong>Algorithm Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Initialize an empty stack.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Traverse the postfix expression from left to right:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>If the current element is an <strong>operand</strong> (number or variable), push it onto the stack.</li>
            <li>If the current element is an <strong>operator</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pop two operands</strong> from the stack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Form a new prefix expression</strong> by placing the operator before the two operands (i.e., operator operand1 operand2).</li>
                    <li><strong>Push the resulting prefix expression</strong> back onto the stack.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>After processing all elements,</strong> the stack will contain only one element: the final <strong>prefix expression</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Code:</strong></p>

```python
def postfixToPrefix(s):
    stack = []

    # Traverse through each character of the postfix expression
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i].isalnum():  # If operand, push to stack
            stack.append(s[i])
        else:  # If operator, pop two operands and form a prefix expression
            op1 = stack.pop()  # First operand
            op2 = stack.pop()  # Second operand
            exp = s[i] + op2 + op1  # Operator before operands in prefix notation
            stack.append(exp)  # Push result back to stack

    # The final element in the stack is the desired prefix expression
    return stack[-1]

# Input and output
s = input("Enter postfix expression: ")
print("Prefix Expression:", postfixToPrefix(s))

```

<p><strong>Example Walkthrough:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>For the input postfix expression <code>AB+C*</code>, the steps are as follows:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Process <code>A</code>: Push <code>A</code> to the stack.</li>
        <li>Process <code>B</code>: Push <code>B</code> to the stack.</li>
        <li>Process <code>+</code>: Pop <code>B</code> and <code>A</code>, form the prefix expression <code>+AB</code>, and push it to the stack.</li>
        <li>Process <code>C</code>: Push <code>C</code> to the stack.</li>
        <li>Process <code>*</code>: Pop <code>C</code> and <code>+AB</code>, form the prefix expression <code>*+ABC</code>, and push it to the stack.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The stack now contains the final prefix expression: <code>*+ABC</code>.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Prefix To Postfix</h2>

<p>Here, prefix should be evaluted from right to left, so we reverse given expression and so same porcess as above</p>

<p><strong>Explanation of Code:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Input:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The function takes a string <code>s</code> representing a prefix expression as input.</li>
            <li>Example: <code>*+AB-CD</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Reverse the Input:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The prefix expression is reversed because prefix expressions are evaluated from right to left.</li>
            <li>Example: Reversed expression: <code>DC-BA+*</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stack Initialization:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>An empty stack is used to store intermediate results during the conversion process.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Traverse the Reversed Expression:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>For each character in the reversed expression:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If the character is an operand (alphanumeric):</strong> Push it directly onto the stack.</li>
                    <li><strong>If the character is an operator:</strong> Pop the top two elements from the stack (<code>op1</code> and <code>op2</code>), form a new postfix expression, and push the result back onto the stack.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Return Final Result:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>After processing all characters, the stack contains the final postfix expression.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
